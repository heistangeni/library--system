# Library Management System

This is a simple console-based **Library System** implemented in Python to demonstrate:

- Inheritance (`Book` and `Magazine` extend `Item`)
- Aggregation (`Shelf` contains `Items`)
- Composition (`Library` contains `Shelves`)
- Polymorphism (`display_info()` method behaves differently)
- Type Checking (`isinstance` used on `Book`)
- Algorithms (searching and counting)
