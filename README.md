# ðŸ“š Library Management System

This is a simple console-based **Library System** implemented in Python to demonstrate:

- **Inheritance** (`Book` and `Magazine` extend `Item`)
- **Aggregation** (`Shelf` contains `Items`)
- **Composition** (`Library` contains `Shelves`)
- **Polymorphism** (`display_info()` method behaves differently)
- **Type Checking** (`isinstance` used on `Book`)
- **Algorithms** (searching and counting)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd library-system
python -m src.main
```

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
